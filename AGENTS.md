## IMPORTANT Guidelines
- Use shadcn ui for all components.
- When using shadcn components, use the MCP server.
  - Apply components wherever components are applicable. Use whole blocks where possible (e.g., login page,
    calendar)
  - When implementing: First call the demo tool to see how it is used. Then implement it so that it is implemented correctly
- Every change you make to the UI in the codebase should be mobile first responsive.
- Use context7 to look up documentation for every package you interact with.
- Only commit when explicitly requested
- Always run `npm run lint` to ensure everything is working and formatted correctly
